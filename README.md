# Pro Football Reference Scraper
This repo contains the code for a web scraper I wrote for [pro-football-reference.com](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/). It scrapes the career statistics for all NFL players, both retired and active. I built this mostly for personal use as I wanted a comprehensive, simple dataset that encompassed all NFL players and their statistics. The resulting dataset can be used for a variety of historical data analysis, interesting visualizations, or predictive modeling. 

# Data
The web scraper outputs 2 files to the `/data/` directory, `player_list.csv` and `player_stats.csv`.
